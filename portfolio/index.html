      <!-- About Me -->
      <div class="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hey, I'm Smitesh Magdum, a passionate tech enthusiast currently
          pursuing my BSc in IT (2nd semester) at Mumbai University. I'm deeply
          interested in Full Stack Development and actively learning
          technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js to build
          dynamic and responsive web applications. In addition to web
          development, I enjoy Competitive Programming in C++, where I solve
          challenging problems to sharpen my problem-solving skills and
          logic-building abilities. I believe in continuous learning and
          improvement, which is why I actively explore new frameworks, tools,
          and best practices in software development. I'm always open to new
          opportunities, whether it's contributing to open-source, working on
          real-world projects, or networking with like-minded developers. I'm
          currently focusing on improving my DSA (Data Structures and
          Algorithms) skills to write more efficient and optimized code.

          <strong>TO-DO-LIst</strong><br /><br />
          I have built a To-Do List project that helps users efficiently manage
          their daily tasks. It allows users to add, and delete tasks, ensuring
          better organization and productivity. The app features a clean UI and
          a responsive design, making it easy to use across different devices. I
          developed it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This project helped me
          improve my skills in DOM manipulation and state management

          <strong>Qr Code Generator</strong><br /><br />
          QR Code Generator is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to
          generate QR codes instantly. Users can enter text, URLs, or any other
          data, and the tool converts it into a scannable QR code. Built using
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it ensures a smooth and responsive
          experience. The generated QR codes can be downloaded or shared easily.
          This project is perfect for businesses, social media links, and
          contactless sharing.

          <strong>Password Genrator</strong><br /><br />
          I have built a Strong Password Genrator that helps you to take strong
          password for your persnal accounts and also for professinal accounts.
          Built using HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT it ensures a smooth and responsive
          experience , This project is perfect for person that cannot write a

          <strong>Login Page</strong><br><br>
          I have made a Login Page that checks the username and password, and if
          they are correct, it redirects the user to my X (Twitter) account. I
          built this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making the validation
          process smooth and instant. The page ensures that only users with the
          right credentials can proceed, adding a basic layer of security. This
          project helped me understand form validation, JavaScript logic, and
          redirection. In the future, I can improve it by adding a real
          authentication system with a database.
